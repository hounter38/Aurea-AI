Now re-download on your PC and it will work with zero setup — no PostgreSQL, no API keys needed:


https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI/archive/refs/heads/cursor/development-environment-setup-a82e.zip
Extract it, then just two commands:


cd C:\Users\ahmad\Downloads\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
You should see:


DATABASE_URL not set — using in-memory storage
serving on port 5000
Then open http://localhost:5000/api/health in your browser — it will show {"status":"ok"}. And the Android app will connect.

I can't share actual secret values for security reasons, but I can tell you exactly what secrets exist on Replit and what you need to set up in Cursor. Let me check what's configured here:

Loaded environment-secrets skill
Here's the full picture. I can't expose or copy secret values (that's a security restriction), but I can tell you exactly what each one is and how to set them up in Cursor.

On Replit (already configured - no action needed):

Secret	What it is	Status
DATABASE_URL	PostgreSQL connection string	Auto-managed by Replit
PGDATABASE, PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD	Individual DB credentials	Auto-managed by Replit
AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY	OpenAI API key	Set via Replit integration
AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL	OpenAI proxy URL	Set via Replit integration
SESSION_SECRET	Session encryption key	Already set
REPLIT_DOMAINS, REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN, REPL_ID	Replit platform vars	Auto-managed
Everything here is already working. No changes needed on the Replit side.

For Cursor / local development, you need to create a .env file with these values. Let me create an .env.example file in the repo that tells Cursor exactly what to set:

Now let me push this update to GitHub:

Done. Here's what you need to do on the Cursor side:

Step 1: In your Cursor project folder, create a file called .env (just .env, no extension) and add:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key
SESSION_SECRET=any-random-string-here
That's the minimum to get AI features working. The app will use in-memory storage (no database needed), and Google Calendar sync will be skipped gracefully.

Step 2 (optional, for full functionality): If you want a real database, add a DATABASE_URL line pointing to a free PostgreSQL service like Neon or Supabase.

Where to get your OpenAI key:

Go to platform.openai.com/api-keys
Click "Create new secret key"
Copy it and paste it as OPENAI_API_KEY in your .env file
On Replit — everything is already configured and working. No changes needed here.

The .env.example file is now in your GitHub repo with all the instructions. Cursor can read it and know exactly what secrets are needed.

Thought for 5 seconds
Good info from Gemini. The code I pushed already handles all of that — you don't need any API keys to get started. Everything falls back to demo mode.

But let me make sure SESSION_SECRET also has a fallback so it doesn't crash:

Grepped SESSION_SECRET in server
Grepped session" in server
No session usage in the server — so no SESSION_SECRET needed. The code I pushed already works with zero config. Just re-download and run:


https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI/archive/refs/heads/cursor/development-environment-setup-a82e.zip
Then:


cd C:\Users\ahmad\Downloads\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
No .env file needed. It will show:


DATABASE_URL not set — using in-memory storage
serving on port 5000
Then:

Browser: http://localhost:5000/api/health → should show {"status":"ok"}
Android app: should show "Server: Connected"
Once that works, you can optionally add an .env file later with your OPENAI_API_KEY to get real AI analysis instead of the demo simulation.
