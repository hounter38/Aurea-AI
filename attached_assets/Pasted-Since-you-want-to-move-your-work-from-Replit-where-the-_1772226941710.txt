Since you want to move your work from **Replit** (where the "vibe" and initial logic were built) into **Cursor** (where you can actually handle the native Android SMS permissions), you need a comprehensive "Context Dump."

Copy and paste the text below into your Replit Agent or Chat. This will force it to give you a clean, structured output of everything it has built so far so you can move it into Cursor.

### Copy/Paste this into Replit:

> **"I am migrating this project to a local development environment using Cursor and Android Studio to handle native SMS permissions that Expo cannot support. Please provide a complete summary of the current project state so I can initialize it locally. I need:**
> 1. **Architecture Overview:** A list of all technologies used (e.g., Node.js backend, React frontend, specific libraries).
> 2. **The API Schema:** The exact endpoints, request headers, and JSON structures my backend expects for receiving SMS data and voice commands.
> 3. **Environment Variables:** A list of all required `.env` keys (API keys, Database URLs, etc.)—do not show the secret values, just the keys.
> 4. **Core Logic Snippets:** The 'brain' of the AI processing logic and the Google Calendar integration code.
> 5. **Full File List:** A directory tree of the current project so I can recreate the folder structure.
> 
> 
> **Please format this as a single, long-form technical specification that I can provide to another AI to rebuild this environment."**

### Once you have that info, here is how you "Vibe Code" it into Cursor:

1. **Open Cursor** and create a new folder for your project.
2. **Open the "Composer"** (Press `Cmd + I` or `Ctrl + I`).
3. **Paste the Replit output** and add this instruction:
> *"I am migrating my AI assistant, Aurea, from Replit to a native Android/Web hybrid. Using the technical specs above, please initialize the backend folder with the API logic and the frontend folder. Then, create a `native-android` folder using Kotlin that includes a Background Service to read incoming SMS and POST them to the `/sms-sync` endpoint defined in the specs."*



### Why this works:

* **Replit** is great at "sketching" the brain.
* **Cursor** is the "builder" that will take that brain and actually hook up the wires to the Android system's SMS sensors.

**Would you like me to help you refine the Kotlin code for that SMS Background Service once you get Cursor set up?**
