Worked for 50s
The server is running but routes are returning 404. This is likely because you have older code. Look at the terminal where the server is running — are there any red error messages after "Aurea server running"?

Either way, the fastest fix is to re-download the latest code from GitHub. You need my recent fixes. Do this:

Stop the server — press Ctrl+C in that terminal
Download the latest code — open this URL in your browser:

https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI/archive/refs/heads/cursor/development-environment-setup-a82e.zip
Extract the ZIP to your Downloads folder (replace the old one)
Open a new Command Prompt and run:

cd C:\Users\ahmad\Downloads\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
Then open http://localhost:5000/api/health in your browser
This will get you the latest code with all the Vite and networking fixes.

This localhost page can’t be found

Now on your PC:

Stop the server — press Ctrl+C
Re-download the latest code:

https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI/archive/refs/heads/cursor/development-environment-setup-a82e.zip
Extract, then in Command Prompt:

cd C:\Users\ahmad\Downloads\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
Open http://localhost:5000/api/health in your browser — it should now show {"status":"ok",...}
The fix: the server now starts the API first, then tries to set up the frontend. Even if Vite fails on Windows, the API will keep working and your Samsung app can connect.

ed/schema.ts)
Build server/ — Express + routes + aiEngine + googleCalendar + storage + Vite middleware
Build client/ — React + Vite + wouter + shadcn/ui + all 6 pages
Scaffold android-app/ — Kotlin companion app with SMS/Call interception
Install deps, run Drizzle push, verify npm run dev works
End-to-end demo: ingest SMS, process with AI, create calendar event
Update AGENTS.md, update script, commit and push

All of those items are already done in the current project. Let me walk you through each one:

Project structure — Already clean. No old backend/, frontend/, mobile/ scaffolds. The structure is server/, client/, shared/, android-app/.

Root package.json — Already configured with TypeScript, Vite, Express, Drizzle, shadcn dependencies.

PostgreSQL + Drizzle schema — shared/schema.ts is set up with users and detectedEvents tables, already pushed to the database.

Server — server/routes.ts, server/aiEngine.ts, server/googleCalendar.ts, server/storage.ts, and Vite middleware (server/vite.ts) are all built and working.

Client — React + Vite + wouter + shadcn/ui with all 6 pages: Dashboard, Inbox (Analyze), Events, Voice, Calendar, Setup.

Android app — android-app/ folder has the complete Kotlin project with SMS/Call interception, WorkManager, BroadcastReceiver, CalendarHelper, and DateExtractor.

Dependencies + database — All installed, Drizzle pushed, npm run dev runs successfully.

End-to-end flow — Tested and working. SMS ingestion via POST /api/sms/ingest processes messages through AI, auto-confirms high-confidence events, and creates Google Calendar events.

Documentation — replit.md is up to date, and android-app/MIGRATION_SPEC.md has the full technical spec.

The app is running right now. Everything on that list is already complete. Is there something specific you'd like to add or change?

I need you. To everything that you finished there. Create a coffee table text that cursor can understand. So it could not have to run through that and process it itself. If you just copy paste it and send it to it.

were do i copy from

https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI.git

ok niow'

What would you like to work on next? Is there a specific feature you want to add, something to fix, or are you ready to publish the app?

i gave u acess to my get hub via conecctionjs did that help

Let me check if the GitHub connection is available now:

Loaded integrations skill
Let me search for GitHub integrations to see if your connection is available:

Your GitHub connection is available. Let me wire it up to this project and see if I can use it to push code to your repo:

The GitHub connection is wired up. Now I need to authorize the OAuth token so I can actually use it. Let me do that:

GitHub is connected. Now let me push your project code to your repo:

Now let me write a script to push all the project files to your GitHub repo:

Good, I have the full file list. Now let me write a script to push everything to your GitHub repo using the Octokit API:

Now let me run it:

All 149 files have been pushed to your GitHub repo. You can see everything at:

https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI

That includes the complete web app (server, client, shared schema), the Android companion app, the migration spec, all config files, and the icons/assets. Your repo is now fully up to date with everything we've built.


Worked for 9m 35s
Now re-download on your PC and it will work with zero setup — no PostgreSQL, no API keys needed:


https://github.com/hounter38/Aurea-AI/archive/refs/heads/cursor/development-environment-setup-a82e.zip
Extract it, then just two commands:


cd C:\Users\ahmad\Downloads\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e\Aurea-AI-cursor-development-environment-setup-a82e
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
You should see:


DATABASE_URL not set — using in-memory storage
serving on port 5000
Then open http://localhost:5000/api/health in your browser — it will show {"status":"ok"}. And the Android app will connect.
