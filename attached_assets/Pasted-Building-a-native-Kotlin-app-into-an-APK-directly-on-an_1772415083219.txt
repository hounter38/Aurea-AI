Building a native Kotlin app into an APK **directly on an Android phone** is possible, but it requires a bit of a "hacker" setup because phones aren't naturally designed to compile professional software.

Since you've had trouble with `keytool` and Java before, doing this on your phone actually solves that because we can set up a fresh environment that doesn't have your PC's old errors.

### The "Termux" Method (Most Reliable)

This is the only way to run the actual `./gradlew assembleDebug` command you saw in your notes, but directly on your phone.

1. **Install Termux:** Download it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) (the Play Store version is outdated).
2. **Set up the Build Tools:** Open Termux and paste these commands one by one (this installs the Java and Android tools you were missing on your PC):
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install openjdk-17 wget zip unzip

```


3. **Download your Project:**
* If your code is on GitHub: `pkg install git && git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]`
* If it's just on your phone storage: Run `termux-setup-storage`, then `cp -r /sdcard/Download/your-project-folder .`


4. **The "Magic" Build Command:**
Navigate to your `android-app` folder and run:
```bash
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew assembleDebug

```


5. **Find your APK:** Once it finishes (it might take 5–10 minutes), your file will be at:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### The "AIDE" Method (Easiest UI)

If you don't like typing commands, there is an app called **AIDE-IDE for Android Java C++** (available on the Play Store).

1. Download **AIDE**.
2. Open your Kotlin project folder inside AIDE.
3. It will recognize the Android project structure.
4. Tap **Run** or **Build**. It will compile the code and immediately ask if you want to install the resulting APK.

### Why this is better for your SMS/Calendar project

Since you specifically need to read **SMS** and write to **Google Calendar**:

* **Real-time testing:** When you build the APK on your phone and install it, you can immediately test if the "Allow" permission pop-up appears.
* **No Keytool Headache:** Both Termux and AIDE will generate a "Debug Key" automatically behind the scenes. You won't have to manually run `keytool` like you did on March 1st.

### ⚠️ One final check for your code

Before you build, make sure your `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` has these specific lines, or the app will be "blind" to your texts:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR" />

```
